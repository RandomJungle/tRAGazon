> **What is a good recipe that uses Salmon and Mushrooms ?**
> 
> Based on the provided context, a recipe that uses salmon and mushrooms is Teriyaki Salmon. This recipe calls for 6 salmon fillets and 1 pound of brussels sprouts, halved if large, as well as 8 oz of shiitake mushrooms. The salmon fillets are combined with a teriyaki sauce made from low-sodium teriyaki sauce, honey, rice vinegar, chopped garlic, grated ginger, and dark sesame oil. The brussels sprouts and shiitake mushrooms are cooked separately and served as a side dish.

In here the top of the context list is pulled into the answer, simple enough. 

> **What is a good recipes that uses strawberries, green tea and stilton cheese ?**
> 
> I'm sorry, based on the provided context, there is no recipe that combines strawberries, green tea, and Stilton cheese. The recipes given are for "Sherried Stilton and Green Peppercorn Spread", "Mixed Green Salad with Strawberry Dressing", and "Cheese Board with Roasted Strawberries, Garlic & Herb Nuts, and Honey & Orange Roasted Figs", as well as instructions for a cheese platter with "Stilton with Della Robbia Fruits and Nuts". None of these recipes include green tea or combine all three ingredients you mentioned.

Using on purpose a list of ingredients that are unlikely to appear together, the context list is observed to not match exactly the question

The issue here is that, since the question is talking explicitly about minestrone, the top retrieved context recipes are all Minestrone recipes, so the answer does not extend beyond Minestrone

> **Give me salmon recipes that do not use any herbs**
> 
> Based on the provided context, the following recipes do not include any herbs:
>
>1. Roasted Salmon With Green Herbs: You can simply omit the herbs from this recipe.
>
> 2. Super Herbed Saut√©ed Salmon with Creamy Leeks and Bacon: This recipe does not include any herbs in the salmon portion.

Here, the question include herbs and so it weighs in the similarity for the retriever, which collects as its top answer only recipes that heavily accent the herb part in their title.
